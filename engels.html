        Freeride Mountain Biking can loosely be defined as riding trails, doing tricks and upgrading your skills. It is definitely not about how fast you can go down a hill. With Freeride MTB you are going to push your boundaries. You drive over anything you are able to drive over. Next to that you learn how to jump with your MTB. Of course everything with guidance of professionals. <br><br>

            Wingsuit flying is a skydiving sport where you glide through the air in a special suit. This special suit is called a ‘wingsuit’. The wingsuit generates increased lift, which lets you stay longer in the air. Also you are gliding through the air instead of just falling down which happens when you skydive. You end your flight with opening your parachute, the same as being used for parachuting and base jumping. The max speed is 400 kilometer per hour. <br><br>
