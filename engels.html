        Freeride Mountain Biking can loosely be defined as riding trails, doing tricks and upgrading your skills. It is definitely not about how fast you can go down a hill. With Freeride MTB, you are going to push your boundaries. You drive over anything you are able to drive over. Next to that, you learn how to jump with your MTB. Of course, everything with guidance of professionals. <br><br>

            Wingsuit flying is a skydiving sport where you glide through the air in a special suit. This special suit is called a ‘wingsuit’. The wingsuit generates increased lift, which lets you stay longer in the air. Also you are gliding through the air instead of just falling down which happens when you skydive. You end your flight with opening your parachute, the same as being used for parachuting and base jumping. The max speed is 400 kilometers per hour. <br><br>

        Skydiving is jumping out of a flying plane. When you jumped out of the plane you start with a free fall. After that, you open your parachute and you fly to your destination.<br><br>
        Location: multiple locations also depending on weather conditions<br>

        Online events are unthinkable these days and are almost being seen as ‘’normal’’.<br>
        So why should you postpone an event with a big group of people when you can organize an online event.<br>
        This day there are many different and unique types of online events possible. Think about an interactive online event, live event of an combination of both.<br>
        Stegmann Events can help you organize an online event as you like with a live stream studio including video, light and sound equipment.<br>
        That is possible with company brand/logo, technicians and free possibility to record the event and to stream the event via social media.
